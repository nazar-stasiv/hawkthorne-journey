* Game

Journey  to the  Center of  Hawkthorne is  2d platformer  is based  on
Community's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Estate_Planning][Digital Estate Planning]] episode. It's built using the [[https://love2d.org/][LÃ–VE]]
game engine. Please [[https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues?state=open][report any issues or bugs]] you have with the game!

** Download the game
- [[http://files.projecthawkthorne.com/releases/latest/hawkthorne-osx.zip][OS  X]]
- [[http://files.projecthawkthorne.com/releases/latest/hawkthorne-win-x86.zip][Windows]]

** Contribute to the game

All discussion  and development takes  place on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne][/r/hawkthorne]].  If you
have  any contributions  you'd  like  to submit,  either  open a  pull
request or  create a post on  the subreddit. The steps  below are only
needed if you want to write code for the game.

*** Getting started with development on OS X / Linux

Getting start is easy. Just clone the repository and run =make run=.

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone git://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey.git
$ cd hawkthorne-journey
$ make run
#+end_src

*** Getting started with development on Windows

First, download and install [[http://windows.github.com/][Github for Windows]] which will setup git on
your computer. You'll also  need PowerShell, which comes pre-installed
on Windows 7 & 8.

Once you've  installed and logged  in with  Github for Windows,  go to
=https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey=  and  click the  =Fork=
button

After   you've    successfully   forked    the   repository    go   to
=https://github.com/<your  username>/hawkthorne-journey=  and click  the
"Clone in Windows" button.

Once you  have the  repo, click  on it in  Github for  Windows, select
"tools > open a shell here".

In your new PowerShell window, run

#+begin_src powershell
> .\make.ps1 run
#+end_src

*** Next steps

Congratulations! You're  running Journey to the  Center of Hawkthorne!
Your next steps can be:

- Fix [[https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey/issues?labels=bug&state=open][bugs]] with the game
- Add new features and content to the game

** Community
- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne][/r/hawkthorne subreddit]]
- [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hawkthorne][#hawkthorne@irc.freenode.net]] on IRC

** Releasing a new version

We release a new version of  Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne about
every two  weeks. To create  a release, open  a pull request  from the
=master= branch to the =release=  branch. You should never commit directly
to the =release= branch.

** Minimal Fennel Love2D Setup

In the lead up to the semi-annual [[https://itch.io/jam/autumn-lisp-game-jam-2018][Autumn Lisp Game Jam]] I thought I'd look into Phil Hegelberg's approach to last Aprils Jam, using [[https://love2d.org/][love2d]] in concert with [[https://fennel-lang.org/][fennel]]. Phil outlines his approach on his [[https://technomancy.us/187][blog]].

This repo contains the minimal viable setup to get started with Phil Hegelberg's game design process, plus some additional libraries.

** Alternatives
This repo is slowly expanding from a truly minimal setup to one that comes with a few batteries included. If you want a barebones setup to get you started check out:
[[https://sr.ht/~benthor/absolutely-minimal-love2d-fennel/][absolutely-minimal-love2d-fennel]] by @benthor.

If you want to just start coding up some fennel and love with no makefile or manual installation on linux check out [[https://gitlab.com/alexjgriffith/love-fennel][love-fennel]]

** Getting Started
The following commands will clone this project and duplicate its structure into a new folder =$PROJECT_NAME=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/alexjgriffith/min-love2d-fennel.git 
./min-love2d-fennel/.duplicate/new-game.sh $PROJECT_NAME
#+END_SRC

Check out the makefile and conf.lua files in =$PROJECT_NAME=, updating them with information relevant to your game.

You can enter =love .= in the =$PROJECT_NAME= directory to run your game, or =make run=. If you are on Windows, using =lovew .= will allow you to use the REPL.

The following lines with =Update= should be changed in the =makefile= and =love.conf= to reflect your game.

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  VERSION=0.1.0
  LOVE_VERSION=11.4
  NAME=change-me # Update
  ITCH_ACCOUNT=change-me-too # Update
  URL=https://gitlab.com/alexjgriffith/min-love2d-fennel # Update
  AUTHOR="Your Name" # Update
  DESCRIPTION="Minimal setup for trying out Phil Hagelberg's fennel/love game design process." # Update
  GITHUB_USERNAME := $(shell grep GITHUB_USERNAME credentials.private | cut -d= -f2) # Optional (needed for Love V 12.0)
  GITHUB_PAT := $(shell grep GITHUB_PAT credentials.private | cut -d= -f2) # Optional (needed for Love V 12.0)

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
love.conf = function(t)
   t.gammacorrect = true
   t.title, t.identity = "change-me", "Minimal" -- Update
   t.modules.joystick = false
   t.modules.physics = false
   t.window.width = 720
   t.window.height = 450
   t.window.vsync = false
   t.version = "11.4"
end
#+END_SRC

** Emacs Setup

Once you install the latest version of [[https://gitlab.com/technomancy/fennel-mode][fennel-mode]], you can run
=C-u M-x fennel-repl= followed by =love .= to launch a repl.

** Default Project Structure

The =make= process as-is will only compile the contents of the root folder and the =lib/= folder+subfolders, so make sure to put your game files in either of those. 

Specifically, every =.fnl= file needed at runtime needs to be situated in the root folder, and every file which is not a =.lua= or =.fnl= file needs to be put inside =lib/=.

In order to use macros, they have to be put in =.fnl= files inside =lib/=.

** Separate your Code into a /src directory

  If you want a more opinionated layout, you can use pass in a =--layout= parameter when creating your project.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./min-love2d-fennel/.duplicate/new-game.sh $PROJECT_NAME --layout=seperate-source
#+END_SRC

This build uses =gamestate= rather than Phil's approach to scene separation and puts all your =.fnl= files into a =/src= directory. It also provides a separate makefile that handles this layout. 

Note, any macros will have to be placed in the root of the project or in the =lib= folder (this can be modified in =main.lua=)

Presently the only layouts are =clone= and =seperate-source=. If you want to make your own check out the =.duplicate= directory to see how they work.

** Release Process

Use =make linux=, =make windows=,  =make mac=, or =make web= to create targets for each platform, or =make release= to make all four. Check out the makefile for more commands, and remember to edit your game data in it!

** Adjusting the screen size
For those of us working with window managers it would be nice if our games behaved while we are developing. Below is code adapted from Phil's 2022 lisp game jam entry [[https://codeberg.org/technomancy/lisp-jam-2022/src/branch/main/wrap.fnl][https://codeberg.org/technomancy/lisp-jam-2022/src/branch/main/wrap.fnl]] . Adapt it to modify your =wrap.fnl= to handle window resizing automatically and adjust your mouse position.

*Note* this is _not a complete solution_. You still need to handle the translation of =love.mouse.getPos= and =love.graphics.inverseTransform=. But, if your game dosn't use those, the snippet below should work out of the box!

#+BEGIN_SRC fennel
  ;; define the size of your window. From your program's perspective
  ;; your window will always be this size regardless of size
  (local window-w 1280)
  (local window-h 720)
  (var scale 1)
  
  ;; Love provides a handy resize callback. Hook into it to adjust the display size
  ;; of your window.
  (fn love.resize [w h]
    (set scale (math.floor (math.max 1 (math.min (/ w window-w)
                                                 (/ h window-h))))))

  ;; Changing the display size means that you need to translate from the "display size"
  ;; to the size your game thinks the window is.
  (fn love.mousepressed [x y b]
    (when mode.mousepressed
      (safely #(mode.mousepressed (/ x scale) (/ y scale) b set-mode))))

  (fn love.mousemoved [x y dx dy istouch]
    (when mode.mousemoved
      (safely #(mode.mousemoved (/ x scale) (/ y scale) (/ dx scale) (/ dy scale)
                                istouch))))

  (fn love.mousereleased [x y b]
    (when mode.mousereleased
      (safely #(mode.mousereleased (/ x scale) (/ y scale) b set-mode))))

#+END_SRC

** Targeting the development branch of love (12.0) - LINUX ONLY
You can target the development branch of love (version 12.0) by setting the `LOVE_VERSION` parameter in the makefile to 12.0. Note that because we are working from a github artifact, rather than a release, you will also have to pass in your github username and a github PAT.

*** Getting a PAT
To download artifacts created by the Github actions CI you will need to get an access token from "settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens". The token needs `workflow` and `actions:read` permissions.

*** Creating a credentials.private file
By default the makefile looks for `credentials.private` in the root directory of the project. `*.private` is part of `.gitignore` so personal information stored here will not be part of the git history or get pushed to a remote server.

The contents should look something like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
GITHUB_USERNAME=username
GITHUB_PAT=PAT
#+END_SRC

Note: this is presently linux only, however it may be expanded in the future to cover macos and windows.

** Phil's Modal Callbacks (PMC)

Phil Hegelberg's [[https://gitlab.com/technomancy/exo-encounter-667/][exo-encounter-667]] is structured using a modal callback system. Each game state has a mode and each mode has a series of specific callbacks.

If you design your game as a series of states in a very simple state machine, for example *start-screen*, *play* and *end*, with unidirectional progression, you can easily separate the logic for each state into state/mode specific callbacks. As an example, in order to have state dependant rendering that differs between start-screen,play and end you could provide a *draw* callback for each of those states. Similarly if we need state dependent logic and keyboard input we could provide *update* and *keyboard* callbacks. As you iterate you can add and remove callbacks and states/modes as needed with very little friction.
