*** Getting started with development on OS X / Linux

Getting start is easy. Just clone the repository and run =make run=.

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone git://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey.git
$ cd hawkthorne-journey
$ make run
#+end_src

*** Getting started with development on Windows

First, download and install [[http://windows.github.com/][Github for Windows]] which will setup git on
your computer. You'll also  need PowerShell, which comes pre-installed
on Windows 7 & 8.

Once you've  installed and logged  in with  Github for Windows,  go to
=https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey=  and  click the  =Fork=
button

After   you've    successfully   forked    the   repository    go   to
=https://github.com/<your  username>/hawkthorne-journey=  and click  the
"Clone in Windows" button.

Once you  have the  repo, click  on it in  Github for  Windows, select
"tools > open a shell here".

In your new PowerShell window, run

#+begin_src powershell
> .\make.ps1 run
#+end_src
